# directa

Directa is a bytecode-interpreted language designed to address some particular shortcomings of other interpreted languages. It combines the flexibility of the "everything is an object" paradigm with the power of concrete value types, emphasises safe practices, and is easy to learn. Try it today!

The compiler and source interpreter are written in C#, while the bytecode virtual machine is written in C. 

> As this is a pet project of mine, at this time the language does not compile. I welcome any and all contributions!
