# directa

Directa is a bytecode-interpreted language designed to address some particular shortcomings of other interpreted languages. It combines the flexibility of the "everything is an object" paradigm with the power of concrete value types, emphasises safe practices, and is easy to learn. Try it today!

The compiler and source interpreter are written in C#, while the bytecode virtual machine is written in C.

## Background

I've been in love with programming since day 1, when I started out with a silly little mod for Minecraft. However, I have always been torn between choice of language. Many different languages have their own niceties or annoyances, and I'd always think of how I could do a personal project differently if I had ended up choosing language `x`. Directa is my attempt at combining the parts of many languages that I personally like. You'll notice this in the way programs are constructed - I've borrowed bits and pieces from Python and .NET (among others).

I am by no means the best programmer in the world, and I am certainly no expert on compiler technology. This is simply a hobby project for me to actually try to theorise about the things I read about programming.

Any and all contributions are certainly welcome :)
